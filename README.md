# up221-Catherine
## Self-intro
Hi, my name is Catherine Ren. I am a first-year MURP student concentrating in TPP, and I'm interested in learning more about coding.
## Course Description
In UP221, we will explore how geographic data is applied in public policy, urban planning, and related fields. The course is designed to develop a skill set for community practice, equipping each student with the essential tools for effective organization and planning. This will aid in addressing political, economic, and social justice issues in our communities.
## Project Topic-The impact of transportation infrastructure on urban sprawl in California: an investigation of how the expansion of highways and mass transit systems has affected the sprawl of urban areas and changed land use patterns in California.
In this project, I am aiming to investigate how the development of highways and public transit systems has influenced the expansion of urban areas in California. Relationship between transportation infrastructure and changes in land use patterns will be examined, and focus on whether these developments have led to increased urban sprawl. I hope to analyze historical data and patterns of urban growth, and establish a connection with the timeline of the expansion of transportation infrastructure.
## My objectives for the class
I hope I can learn how to use Python and gain experience in data analysis.
